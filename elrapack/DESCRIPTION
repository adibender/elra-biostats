Description: This package is not for general use in statistical analyses, but rather
	a collection of functions to reproduce analyses in Bender et. al (2017).
	It's just simpler to collect and document these functions using the R-package
	infrastructure. Variable names etc. are often hard coded in the function bodys,
	therefore, these functions should not be used outside of reproduction of
	the results and simulation in Bender et. al (2017). See
	https://github.com/adibender/pamm for a package for piece-wise exponential
	additive models.
Depends: R (>= 3.4.1)
